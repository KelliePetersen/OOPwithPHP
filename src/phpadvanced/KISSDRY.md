# KISS
Keep it Simple, Stupid.  
The KISS principle is to keep everything simple and clear.
* Methods should be small
* Methods should handle one problem
* Methods should not contain multiple conditionals
If a method violates the KISS principle, refactor it into multiple smaller methods.

# DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself.  
Divide your system into pieces. Divide your code and logic into smaller reusable units and use that code by calling it where you want. 
Don't write lengthy methods, but divide logic and try to use the existing piece in your method.
